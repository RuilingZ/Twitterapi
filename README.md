# Twitter APIs

* In this project, I try to use the [twitter api](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/searching.html)
* The API need to get a set of application tokens, then use the function Api() to create a API Model.
* I use two api functions __GetSearch__ and __GetUsersSearch__, these two function can return twitter search results and user search results for a given term.
